# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game

This is an extended verion of the starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). I have added the following features:
* Ability to pause/resume the game.
* Random obstacles with the ability to change every time a player eats the food.
* A GUI to let the player know how to start, resume and pause the game.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  * Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source.
* SDL_ttf >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## Meets Rubric

1. The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.
2. The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.
3. Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.
4. Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.
5. Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.
6. Classes encapsulate behavior.
7. The project makes use of references in function declarations.
